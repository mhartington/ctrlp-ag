# Use ctrlp.vim to search for anything you like
### Input
Provide ctrlp with a simple list of strings to search in.

### Output
Specify an action to perform on the selected string.

## Example:
To see how it works, get the [sample.vim][1] from this branch and place it
(along with the directories) somewhere in your runtimepath. Then put this into
your vimrc, a new search type will show up when you open CtrlP:

```vim
let g:ctrlp_extensions = ['sample']
```

_Check out [sample.vim][1] for more details. For a list of extensions bundled with CtrlP, see `:help ctrlp-extensions`._

### Extensions in the wild:
* [tacahiroy/ctrlp-funky][2]
* [sgur/ctrlp-extensions.vim][3]
* [mark][4], [register][5], [launcher][6] and [hackernews][7] by [mattn][8]
* and [others][9].
